if you ever get in to trouble and can't do anything,
you will say "help", and i'll help you.
if i ever get lost in the middle of nowhere,
i will say "help", and you'll light the way.
if we find out what we are made of,
then we will help our friends in need.
so we will spend our time to stick together.
and we will find what me are made of.
and when you say "help", i will sail the world, and help you.
